### Summary
- You started with a dataset of 500 events.
- By applying event selection or cuts, you reduced the dataset to a smaller subset focused on meaningful events.
- You vizualized the distribution of the leading lepton energy of the reduced dataset.
    
If everything is clear, in the next step you can use similar filteres on real events to identify specific particles, such as the Z boson or Higgs boson. Happy analyzing!
