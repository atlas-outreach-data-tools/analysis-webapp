Intially, this dataset has {data} rows or events

##### Understanding the Columns
Hereâ€™s what the columns in the dataset mean:
- **EventID**: A unique identifier for each event recorded in the detector. Each event corresponds to a snapshot of what happens during a single particle collision in the detector.
- **nLeptons**: The total number of leptons reconstructed in the event. In this simplified mock dataset, we focus on events with 2, 3, or 4 leptons, which is typical for certain analyses. In reality, leptons counts can vary significantly depending on the physics process being studied.
- **Leading Lepton Energy (GeV)**: The energy of the highest-momentum lepton in an event, measured in giga-electronvolts (GeV). This value represents the most energetic lepton among all detected leptons in the event, providing key insights into the event's dynamics.
