Intially, this dataset has {data} rows or events

##### Understanding the Columns
Hereâ€™s what the columns in the dataset mean:
- **EventID**: A unique identifier for each event recorded in the detector. Each event corresponds to a snapshot of what happens during a single particle collision in the detector.
- **nParticles**: The total number of particles reconstructed in the event. In this simplified mock dataset, we focus on events with 2, 3, or 4 particles, which is typical for certain analyses. In reality, particle counts can vary significantly depending on the physics process being studied.
- **Leading Lepton Energy (GeV)**: The energy of the highest-energy lepton in an event, measured in giga-electronvolts (GeV). This value represents the most energetic lepton among all detected leptons in the event, providing key insights into the event's dynamics. In the mock dataset, it ranges from 10 to 200 GeV.
