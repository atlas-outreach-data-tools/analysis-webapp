The updated plots below reflect the events remaining after applying your range cut on the leading lepton energy. The bar plot on the left shows the distribution of the number of particles for the filtered events, while the histogram on the right displays the updated energy distribution of the leading lepton. These plots help you visualize the combined effect of both the selection cut and the range cut, offering a understanding of how the dataset has been filtered.
