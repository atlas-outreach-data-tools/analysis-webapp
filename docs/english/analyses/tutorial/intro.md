# Tutorial: Understanding Event Selection
Analyzing data is the foundation of physics research. In experiments like those conducted at the ATLAS detector at CERN, we analyze vast amounts of data to search for evidence of particles. This process involves isolating meaningful collisions or eventsâ€”an essential step for making scientific discoveries. 

This tutorial introduces the concept of **event selection**, or cuts, in data analysis. You'll learn how and why to apply event selection rules, which are filters that refine the dataset to focus on events of interest. Using a dataset extracted from actual experimental data, you'll explore a process to analyze data and uncover patterns. By the end, you'll have a clearer understanding of how cuts are applied, to later use them to reveal the hidden physics within a larger dataset.
