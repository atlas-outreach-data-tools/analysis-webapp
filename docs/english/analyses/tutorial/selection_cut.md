## Selection Cut: Choosing Events by Number of Particles
To begin our analysis, we will apply a **selection cut** to filter events based on the number of particles detected in each event. This property, represented by the nParticles column in the dataset, indicates how many particles were recorded in the event.

By selecting one or more values from the options below (2, 3, or 4), you can refine the dataset to focus only on events that match your selection. For example:
- Selecting 2 filters the dataset to include only events with exactly 2 particles.
- Selecting 3 and 4 retains events with either 3 or 4 particles.

The dataset displayed below will update dynamically to reflect your selection. This allows you to immediately see how the filtered dataset corresponds to events with the selected number of particles. You can check this by looking at the `nParticles` column, and verifying that it only contain the selected options.
