The filtered dataset now contains {filtered_data_size} events. The table below shows only the events matching this selection.

The plots below show the distributions of the events remaining after applying all your selected cuts. The bar plot on the left illustrates the distribution of the number of particles in the selected events, while the histogram on the right shows the energy distribution of the leading lepton. Both plots dynamically update as you modify any of the prior selections (number of particles, lepton type, or energy range), allowing you to visually track the impact of your choices. The x-axis of each plot reflects the corresponding variable, and the y-axis indicates the frequency of events.
